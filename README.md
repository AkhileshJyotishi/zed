# Introduction [](#introduction)

Welcome to Zed, a versatile and production ready smart contract engine that redefines the experience of a smart contract developer. Zed combines exceptional speed, security and intelligence to provide a seamless experience develop, audit and deploy smart contracts. Zed combines powerful tools inspired by Remix, Third Web and OpenZeppelin Wizard enhanced by a finely-tuned AI model to elevate every stage of the development process. With Zed, developers can streamline the entire contract development lifecycle and fasttrack their development journey. Drawing inspiration from leading blockchain development frameworks, Zed not only simplifies complex tasks but also enhances the precision and quality of the smart contracts.

# Motivation [](#motivation)

The motivation behind Zed is to address the common challenges faced by smart contract developers, such as security vulnerabilities, complexity of development, and inefficiencies in the deployment process. By leveraging advanced AI and providing a comprehensive suite of tools, Zed aims to make smart contract development more accessible, secure, and efficient, ultimately fostering innovation and growth within the blockchain ecosystem.

# Tech stack [](#tech)

Zed is built using a robust tech stack to ensure performance, reliability, and scalability:

- Next.js
- Solidity
- Slither
- Hardhat
- Foundry
- AI models

# Core Features [](#core)

Zed is packed with a wide array of features designed to enhance every aspect of smart contract development.
Here is a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **AI powered IDE**

Zed provides an intelligent development environment for solidity where you can write smart contracts from scratch or use pre-built templates. The AI-driven autocompletion suggests code as you type, speeding up the process and reducing errors
